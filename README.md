# Resume
### Greetings!
Resumes should be short, but sometimes you have a feeling that you should put everything about you and your experience into the doc to be as precise as possible...this unfortunately makes it too long and basing on my experience from both sides:

- a Candidate, where you want to put everything into the resume,
- a Technical Recruiter, where you need condensed information, and often you focus only on the experience and technologies,

I've decided to shorten (a lot) my resume, but also to keep an additional info for the curious recruiters, `like you`, somewhere publicly. I'm a developer, so why not in the code repository? I hope this will help you familiarize with my experience and skillset more precisely.
